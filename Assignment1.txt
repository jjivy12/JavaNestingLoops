Look at the first set of nested loops ("CN"). Which variable changes faster? Is it the variable controlled by the outer loop (c) or the variable controlled by the inner loop (n)? Answer in a comment.
Change the order of the loops so that the "c" loop is on the inside and the "n" loop is on the outside. How does the output change?
Look at the second set of nested loops ("AB"). Change the print() statement to println(). How does the output change? (Then change it back to print().)
Add a System.out.println() statement after the close brace of the inner loop (the "b" loop), but still inside the outer loop. How does the output change?

1. The varible controlled by the inneer loop "n" is changing before the varible controlled by the outter loop "c"

2. When the order of the loops are changed the output now reads:
                        A 1
                        B 1
                        C 1
                        D 1
                        E 1
                        A 2
                        B 2
                        C 2
                        D 2
                        E 2
                        A 3
                        B 3
                        C 3
                        D 3
                        E 3
So know it looks like the varible controlled by the outer loop is changing before the varible controlled by the inner.

3.Chaning the Print() statement to a printLn() statement just prints the output on a new line instead of everything being on one line.

4.Addind the system.output.println() statement groups the outerloop varible on one line, then starts a new line as the outer varible changes.
